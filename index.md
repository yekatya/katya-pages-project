#Yekaterina Ruslanovna Kostina

## ** About Me ** ## 

Hello! My name Yekaterina, but that's just the long version of my name. I like to go by Katerina or even Kat because it makes it easier for others. My favorite food is anything sweet but specifically Russian Napoleon cake or medovik cake. Dumplings(pelmeni to be even more specific) comes in at a very close strong second.

>I was in Boston, and despite being from Russia - yes, I was freezing. 

## **Background** ##

I am of mixed race; I am Asian and White. My dad is Russian and my mom is Mongolian of the Buryat people. I was born in Moscow with my little sister who's only 3 years younger than me(Irina Kostina). We all moved to the US in 2005 so that my parents could find a better job. My mom won the green card lottery, and we've stayed here ever since. 

A lot of my interest in mathematics and computer science was strongly influened by my dad who originally started off by studying nuclear physics and eventually got into computer science. He is a software engineer and has helped me with all my STEM related studies - all the way from basic mathematics in elementary school. 

My academic interests include:

- Software Engineering
- Web Development
- Design 

Some of the skills that I've acquired over my studies at UCSD: 

1. Java
2. JavaScript, HTML, CSS
3. Assembly(small amount, small exposure)

I am learning to use git so that I could implement some of my own projects using it in the future. I used it previously at a HackXX hackathon event in 2019 where we designed an app called SafeHome that extended UCSD's CPS service outside of the university campus, however I mainly just used 'git push' and 'git pull'. I'd like to incorporate more into my daily coding routine. 

I currently work as a student on campus for the Center for Student Involvement department. My title is CSI office assistant. It used to be part farmers market, but due to COVID, it hasn't happened for a while and won't be for a few following quarters. Some of my tasks include:

[] Content Management System for [get involved website](https://getinvolved.ucsd.edu/)
[] Documentation 
[] Internal communication/meetings

## **Education ** ##

I am a fourth year undergraduate student at UCSD majoring in applied mathematics and computer science. I am also interested in web development as stated [here](#background). I went to a charter fine arts school in high school called the Orange County School of the Arts where I was accepted into the visual arts conservatory, so my biggest hobby is art. I love to experiment with all types of mediums including digital media, watercolor, oil painting, and plein-air painting to name a few, but my absolute favorite is oil painting since it is the most forgiving.
